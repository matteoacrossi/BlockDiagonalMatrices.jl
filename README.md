# BlockDiagonalMatrices.jl

Functionality for working efficiently with [block diagonal matrices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_matrix#Block_diagonal_matrices).

> **NOTE** This is based on the original [BlockDiagonals.jl](https://github.com/invenia/BlockDiagonals.jl), use that one, I just needed a modified version!
